## Assignment Goals
The goal of this project is to:
-  create an evaporation cooling system

## Program
### Overview
**Swap Cooler Skeleton**
Build a program that can manage all functionalities of a swamp cooler.

## Requirements
The swamp cooler program should: 
-  Monitor the water levels in a reservoir and print an alert when the level is too low 
-  Monitor and display the current air temp and humidity on an LCD screen. 
-  Start and stop a fan motor as needed when the temperature falls out of a specified range (high or low). 
-  Allow a user to use a control to adjust the angle of an output vent from the system 
-  Allow a user to enable or disable the system using an on/off button  
-  Record the time and date every time the motor is turned on or off. This information 
should be transmitted to a host computer (over USB) 

### Constraints
Unless it is specifically mentioned as being allowed, you can not use library functions such
as pinMode, etc. You may use the predefined macros for registers and pin positions.
